### *learning process*
I've had previous experience with HTML/CSS/JS (aka one singular personal portfolio site ! (translation: ... not much experience)), but not with backend programming. the learning curve was been pretty tough, coming with no experience with Node.js or Express. i definitely struggled learning Promise, await/async, naturally, all the server-side work things. i enjoyed understanding how to use .json files though, since I've done some stuff like it with reading/writing files in Java & C. anyways, and here's some useful resources I used:
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API
- https://express.athena.hackclub.com/
- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/node-js/rest-api-using-the-express-to-perform-crud-create-read-update-delete/
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65316870/how-to-use-patch-with-node-js-and-express
- Github Copilot (especially for debugging and explaining concepts)

### *image attributions*
- all images (background and plant sprites) were generated by Copilot

### *future features to be added*
- mood-based plant choices: you get to choose a different kind of plant based on your mood.
- sentiment analysis that evaluates the overall feelings of the mood island.
- plant sprites that are actually hand-drawn and not AI-generated (i didn't have the time to draw them myself..)
- ability to move plants into different slots
- even more plant options

### *help me make this better!!*
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE help me make this better! i know for a fact that even though i have spent nearly 30 hours coding this up, that this has errors and issues everywhere! and also... i did basically all of it in less than 2 weeks. there's bound to be issues (besides the obvious with the display if it's not anywhere near a computer resolution). so my point is! [please let me know and help me make this even better :D](https://github.com/pepper-0/mood-island/issues)
