### last updated 10/7/25

*General Description*
Welcome to the internet's mood island! Here, you can plant, water, admire, and weed plants. Each plant occupies a slot on the mood island, and is a diary entry by someone. 

*Features (tentative)*
- View: click on any plant to view the diary entry within it
- Plant: make your own diary entry!
- Weed: delete/remove plants, requires you to have the erase code (a "password" you set when you plant the diary entry)
- Water: update your entry

- Fulfills express project
- This was made with:
    - HTML
    - CSS
    - JavaScript
    - Node.js
    - Express

*Learning Process*
I've had previous experience with HTML/CSS/JS, but not with backend programming. The learning curve has been pretty tough, coming with no experience with Node.js or Express.

*Features-to-be*
- Expanding island: once the island is completely filled and you try to plant a new entry, you will be given the option to expand the island for the whole internet.
- Mood-based plant choices: you get to choose a different kind of plant based on your mood.
- Sentiment analysis that evaluates the overall feelings of the mood island.
